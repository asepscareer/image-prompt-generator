## About Hosting image-prompt-generator
The image-prompt-generator is an intuitive tool designed to help users create high-quality image prompts for AI models. This application offers a structured interface that allows users to define various aspects of an image, including background, physical attributes of models, clothing, expressions, as well as image quality and composition. This ensures that the generated prompts are highly detailed and specific, making them ideal for fashion editorials or premium brand promotions.

## Common Use Cases
Creating highly detailed image prompts for fashion product marketing campaigns across various social media platforms.

Generating visual concepts for fashion magazines or lookbooks.

Assisting design teams or advertising agencies in formulating consistent and high-quality visual ideas.

Accelerating the content creation workflow for e-commerce or brands requiring specific image outputs.

## Dependencies for image-prompt-generator Hosting
- Flask: A Python web framework used for handling server-side logic and serving web pages.

- Gemini API: Utilized for generating the detailed image prompts based on user input.

- Tailwind CSS: Used for responsive styling and layout, imported via CDN.

- Google Fonts (Inter): Provides modern typography for a professional and clean appearance.

- Font Awesome: Used for icons that enhance the user experience in the interface.

- JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For client-side logic, managing form interactions, and displaying generated prompts.

### Deployment Dependencies
The deployment will require a Python environment for Flask, along with the Flask and requests (or similar HTTP client) libraries for interacting with the Gemini API. Ensure that the Gemini API key is securely managed, ideally as an environment variable in Railway.

### Implementation Details
The application uses a Flask backend to serve the HTML and static assets. When a user submits the form, the client-side JavaScript sends the collected data to a Flask endpoint. The Flask application then constructs a prompt based on this data and calls the Gemini API to enhance or generate the final prompt. This prompt is then sent back to the client-side JavaScript, which displays it to the user.
